When commenting out the this.easingFunction line in the AnimationTimer constructor, I noticed that jumping feels linear and not fluid. When leaving the line in,
jumping has a sort of acceleration effect and more life-life gravity, whereas without that line the jumping animation looks like a consistent speed up and down.
